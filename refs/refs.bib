We sought to determine the economic and epidemiologic impact of incomplete engagement in HIV care in the United States (US).$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nMethods. We constructed a dynamic transmission model of HIV among US adults (15-65) and conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis of improvements along the HIV care continuum. We evaluated: enhanced HIV testing (annual for high-risk groups), increased 3-month linkage to care (to 90{\%}), and improved retention (50{\%} relative reduction in yearly disengagement and 50{\%} increase in reengagement). Our primary outcomes were HIV incidence, mortality, costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nResults. Despite early ART initiation, a projected 1.39 million (95{\%} uncertainty range 0.91-2.2 million) new HIV infections will occur at a (discounted) cost of {\$}256 billion ({\$}199-298 billion) over two decades at existing levels of HIV care engagement. Enhanced testing with increased linkage has modest epidemiologic benefits and could reduce incident HIV infections by 21{\%} (13-26{\%}) at a cost of {\$}65,700 per QALY-gained [{\$}44,500-111,000]). By contrast, comprehensive improvements that couples enhanced testing and linkage with improved retention would reduce HIV incidence by 54{\%} (37-68{\%}) and mortality by 64{\%} (46-78{\%}), at a cost-effectiveness ratio of {\$}45,300 per QALY-gained [{\$}27,800-72,300].$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nConclusions. Failure to improve engagement in HIV care in the United States leads to excess infections, treatment costs, and deaths. Interventions that improve not just HIV screening, but also retention in care, are needed to optimize epidemiological impact and cost-effectiveness.},

abstract = {Background: Roughly 3 million people worldwide were receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) at the end of 2007, but an estimated 6{\textperiodcentered}7 million were still in need of treatment and a further 2{\textperiodcentered}7 million became infected with HIV in 2007. Prevention efforts might reduce HIV incidence but are unlikely to eliminate this disease. We investigated a theoretical strategy of universal voluntary HIV testing and immediate treatment with ART, and examined the conditions under which the HIV epidemic could be driven towards elimination. Methods: We used mathematical models to explore the effect on the case reproduction number (stochastic model) and long-term dynamics of the HIV epidemic (deterministic transmission model) of testing all people in our test-case community (aged 15 years and older) for HIV every year and starting people on ART immediately after they are diagnosed HIV positive. We used data from South Africa as the test case for a generalised epidemic, and assumed that all HIV transmission was heterosexual. Findings: The studied strategy could greatly accelerate the transition from the present endemic phase, in which most adults living with HIV are not receiving ART, to an elimination phase, in which most are on ART, within 5 years. It could reduce HIV incidence and mortality to less than one case per 1000 people per year by 2016, or within 10 years of full implementation of the strategy, and reduce the prevalence of HIV to less than 1{\%} within 50 years. We estimate that in 2032, the yearly cost of the present strategy and the theoretical strategy would both be US{\$}1{\textperiodcentered}7 billion; however, after this time, the cost of the present strategy would continue to increase whereas that of the theoretical strategy would decrease. Interpretation: Universal voluntary HIV testing and immediate ART, combined with present prevention approaches, could have a major effect on severe generalised HIV/AIDS epidemics. This approach merits further mathematical modelling, research, and broad consultation. Funding: None. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Three randomised controlled trials have clearly shown that circumcision of adult men reduces the chance that they acquire HIV infection. However, the potential impact of circumcision programmes--either alone or in combination with other established approaches--is not known and no further field trials are planned. We have used a mathematical model, parameterised using existing trial findings, to understand and predict the impact of circumcision programmes at the population level. FINDINGS: Our results indicate that circumcision will lead to reductions in incidence for women and uncircumcised men, as well as those circumcised, but that even the most effective intervention is unlikely to completely stem the spread of the virus. Without additional interventions, HIV incidence could eventually be reduced by 25-35{\%}, depending on the level of coverage achieved and whether onward transmission from circumcised men is also reduced. However, circumcision interventions can act synergistically with other types of prevention programmes, and if efforts to change behaviour are increased in parallel with the scale-up of circumcision services, then dramatic reductions in HIV incidence could be achieved. In the long-term, this could lead to reduced AIDS deaths and less need for anti-retroviral therapy. Any increases in risk behaviours following circumcision, i.e. 'risk compensation', could offset some of the potential benefit of the intervention, especially for women, but only very large increases would lead to more infections overall. CONCLUSIONS: Circumcision will not be the silver bullet to prevent HIV transmission, but interventions could help to substantially protect men and women from infection, especially in combination with other approaches.},

abstract = {Antiretroviral therapy (ART) reduces the infectiousness of HIV-infected persons, but only after testing, linkage to care, and successful viral suppression. Thus, a large proportion of HIV transmission during a period of high infectiousness in the first few months after infection ("early transmission") is perceived as a threat to the impact of HIV "treatment-as-prevention" strategies. We created a mathematical model of a heterosexual HIV epidemic to investigate how the proportion of early transmission affects the impact of ART on reducing HIV incidence. The model includes stages of HIV infection, flexible sexual mixing, and changes in risk behavior over the epidemic. The model was calibrated to HIV prevalence data from South Africa using a Bayesian framework. Immediately after ART was introduced, more early transmission was associated with a smaller reduction in HIV incidence rate-consistent with the concern that a large amount of early transmission reduces the impact of treatment on incidence. However, the proportion of early transmission was not strongly related to the long-term reduction in incidence. This was because more early transmission resulted in a shorter generation time, in which case lower values for the basic reproductive number (R0) are consistent with observed epidemic growth, and R0 was negatively correlated with long-term intervention impact. The fraction of early transmission depends on biological factors, behavioral patterns, and epidemic stage and alone does not predict long-term intervention impacts. However, early transmission may be an important determinant in the outcome of short-term trials and evaluation of programs.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Antiretroviral drugs can reduce HIV acquisition among uninfected individuals (as pre-exposure prophylaxis: PrEP) and reduce onward transmission among infected individuals (as antiretroviral treatment: ART). We estimate the potential impact and cost-effectiveness of antiretroviral-based HIV prevention strategies. DESIGN AND METHODS: We developed and analysed a mathematical model of a hyperendemic setting with relatively low levels of condom use. We estimated the prevention impact and cost of various PrEP interventions, assuming a fixed amount of spending on PrEP; investigated the optimal role of PrEP and earlier ART in terms of epidemiological impact and cost; and systematically explored the impact of earlier ART and PrEP, in combination with medical male circumcision services; on HIV transmission. RESULTS: A PrEP intervention is unlikely to generate a large reduction in HIV incidence, unless the cost is substantially reduced. In terms of infections averted and quality adjusted life years gained, at a population-level maximal cost-effectiveness is achieved by providing ART to more infected individuals earlier rather than providing PrEP to uninfected individuals. However, early ART alone cannot reduce HIV incidence to very low levels and PrEP can be used cost-effectively in addition to earlier ART to reduce incidence further. If implemented in combination and at ambitious coverage levels, medical male circumcision, earlier ART and PrEP could produce dramatic declines in HIV incidence, but not stop transmission completely. CONCLUSION: A combination prevention approach based on proven-efficacy interventions provides the best opportunity for achieving the much hoped for prevention advance and curbing the spread of HIV.},

abstract = {The HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) 052 study, which showed the effectiveness of antiretroviral treatment in reducing HIV transmission, has been hailed as a "game changer" in the fight against HIV, prompting calls for scaling up treatment as prevention (TasP). However, it is unclear how TasP can be financed, given flat-lining support for global HIV programs. We assess whether TasP is indeed a game changer or if comparable benefits are obtainable at similar or lower cost by increasing coverage of medical male circumcision (MMC) and antiretroviral treatment (ART) at CD4 {\textless}350/muL. We develop a new mathematical model and apply it to South Africa, finding that high ART coverage combined with high MMC coverage provides approximately the same HIV incidence reduction as TasP, for {\$}5 billion less over 2009-2020. MMC outperforms ART significantly in cost per infection averted ({\$}1,096 vs. {\$}6,790) and performs comparably in cost per death averted ({\$}5,198 vs. {\$}5,604). TasP is substantially less cost effective at {\$}8,375 per infection and {\$}7,739 per death averted. The prevention benefits of HIV treatment are largely reaped with high ART coverage. The most cost-effective HIV prevention strategy is to expand MMC coverage and then scale up ART, but the most cost-effective HIV-mortality reduction strategy is to scale up MMC and ART jointly. TasP is cost effective by commonly used absolute benchmarks but it is far less cost effective than MMC and ART. Given South Africa's current annual ART spending, the {\$}5 billion in savings offered by MMC and ART over TasP in the next decade, for similar health benefits, challenges the widely hailed status of TasP as a game changer.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mathematical models of chlamydia transmission can help inform disease control policy decisions when direct empirical evaluation of alternatives is impractical. We reviewed published chlamydia models to understand the range of approaches used for policy analyses and how the studies have responded to developments in the field. METHODS: We performed a literature review by searching Medline and Google Scholar (up to October 2015) to identify publications describing dynamic chlamydia transmission models used to address public health policy questions. We extracted information on modeling methodology, interventions, and key findings. RESULTS: We identified 47 publications (including two model comparison studies), which reported collectively on 29 distinct mathematical models. Nine models were individual-based, and 20 were deterministic compartmental models. The earliest studies evaluated the benefits of national-level screening programs and predicted potentially large benefits from increased screening. Subsequent trials and further modeling analyses suggested the impact might have been overestimated. Partner notification has been increasingly evaluated in mathematical modeling, whereas behavioral interventions have received relatively limited attention. CONCLUSIONS: Our review provides an overview of chlamydia transmission models and gives a perspective on how mathematical modeling has responded to increasing empirical evidence and addressed policy questions related to prevention of chlamydia infection and sequelae.},

 abstract = {A mathematical model of the transmission dynamics of HIV-1 in a heterosexual population stratified by age, sex, and sexual activity (defined by rates of sexual partner acquisition) is presented. The model represents an extension of previous studies with a special focus on patterns of mixing or contact between sexual activity and different age classes of the two sexes. A range of mixing patterns between these groups is specified for both sexes. Mixing is described on two scales from fully assortative to fully disassortative, with random defined either according to numbers of sexual partnerships or numbers of people. The sexual partnerships in the model are balanced by changes in the rates of sexual partner acquisition between particular groups and a range of changes, from only women changing behaviour to only men changing behaviour, are analysed. The pattern of mixing is most influential in determining the shape and magnitude of the epidemic, but the manner in which people choose partners (i.e. dependent on numbers or proportions in the population) is also important. The relative importance of variation in transmission probabilities and mean rates of partner change on the course of the HIV epidemic is also illustrated. The analysis of the sensitivity of predictions to changing parameters in the force of infection term of the model provides a theoretical basis from which the influence of control strategies and the demographic effects of HIV can be analysed.},
