\begin{itemize}
  \item Without turnover ($\zeta = 0$):
  \begin{itemize}
    \item tPAF of High risk group decreases
    \item initially: prevalence \& incidence is higher (concentration without mixing);
    fitted $\beta$ is therefore lower
    \item long-term: prevalence \& incidence is lower (saturation effect without mixing);
    fitted $\beta$ is therefore higher
  \end{itemize}
  \item Without heterogeneity ($\G = 1$):
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{much} slower epidemic: fitted $\beta$ much higher
    \item eventually: larger epidemic
  \end{itemize}
  \item Without population growth ($\nu = \mu$):
  \begin{itemize}
    \item (same as turnover)
    \item initially: prevalence \& incidence is higher (concentration without mixing);
    fitted $\beta$ is therefore lower
    \item long-term: prevalence \& incidence is lower (saturation effect without mixing);
    fitted $\beta$ is therefore higher
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
 with turnover: - decreased risk exposure in the highest risk group -> initial slowing
                -
