Heterogeneity in transmission risk is a consistent characteristic of
epidemics of sexually transmitted infections (STI) \citep{Anderson1991}.
This heterogeneity is often demarcated by identifying
specific populations whose risks of acquisition and onward transmission of STI are the highest,
such that their specific unmet prevention and treatment needs
can sustain local epidemics of STI \citep{Yorke1978}.
Disproportionate risk can be conferred in several ways at the
individual-level (higher number of sexual partners), 
partnership-level (reduced condom use within specific partnership types), 
or structural-level (stigma as a barrier to accessing prevention and treatment services)
\citep{Baral2013}.
The contribution of high risk groups to the overall epidemic
can then be used as an indicator in the appraisal of STI epidemics,
helping to guide intervention priorities
\citep{Shubber2014,Mishra2016}.
\par
Traditionally, contribution to an epidemic was quantified using either:\ %
the classic \textit{population attributable fraction} (PAF)
via the relative risk of incident infections within a risk group
versus the rest of the population
and the relative size of the risk group \citep{Hanley2001};
or the distribution of new infections across subsets of a population
\citep{Case2012,Mishra2014}.
So when small risk groups experience disproportionately higher rate of
incident infections -- e.g. 5 percent of a population acquire 30 percent
of STI infections -- contribution is interpreted as 5 percent of the population contributing to
30 percent of all infections \citep{Pruss-Ustun2013}.
However, the classic PAF does not account for chains of (indirect) transmission, and has been
shown to underestimate the contribution of some higher-risk groups to cumulative
STI infections, especially over time \citep{Mishra2014}.
Thus, transmission models are increasingly being used to quantify
contribution by accounting for indirect transmission and projecting
the \textit{transmission population attributable fraction} (tPAF).
The tPAF is calculated by
simulating counterfactual scenarios where transmission
between specific subgroups is stopped, and
the relative difference in cumulative infections in the total population
over various time-periods is measured \citep{Mishra2014,Mukandavire2018}.
Transmission can be stopped by
setting susceptibility and/or infectiousness to zero in the model \citep{Mishra2014}.
The tPAF is then interpreted as
the fraction of all new infections that stem, directly and indirectly, from
a failure to prevent acquisition and/or to provide effective treatment
in a particular risk group \citep{Mishra2016,Mukandavire2018,Maheu-Giroux2017}.
\par
There is limited evidence on how model structure 
might influence the tPAF of higher risk groups
\citep{Mishra2016,Mukandavire2018,Maheu-Giroux2017},
especially movement of individuals between risk groups,
an epidemiologic phenomenon  that is well-described
in the context of sexual behaviour \citep{Watts2010}.
Such movement is often referred to in the STI epidemiology literature as
\textit{turnover} \citep{Watts2010}.
For example, turnover may reflect entry into or retirement from formal sex work,
or other periods associated with higher STI susceptibility and onward transmission
due to more partners and/or vulnerabilities
\citep{Marston2006,Watts2010}.
Risk group turnover has been shown to
influence the predicted equilibrium prevalence of an STI \citep{Stigum1994,Zhang2012};
the fraction of transmissions occurring during acute HIV infection \citep{Zhang2012};
the basic reproductive number $R_0$ \citep{Henry2015}; and
the coverage of antiretroviral therapy required to achieve HIV epidemic control \citep{Henry2015}.
Yet how, and the extent to which, turnover influences tPAF has yet to be examined.
\par
There is variability in how turnover has been previously implemented
\citep{Stigum1994,Koopman1997,Eaton2014,Boily2015},
in large part because of four main assumptions or epidemiologic
constraints surrounding movement between risk groups.
For example, in the context of turnover, the relative 
size of specific populations in the model 
may be constrained to remain constant over time
\citep{Stigum1994,Koopman1997,Eaton2014},
such as the proportion of individuals who sell sex.
Second, some individuals may enter into high risk groups at an early age,
and subsequently settle into lower risk groups;
thus the distribution of risks among individuals entering into the transmission model
may be assumed to be different from
the distribution of risks among individuals already in the transmission model
\citep{Eaton2014}.
Third, turnover may be constrained to reflect the average duration of time spent 
within a given risk group \citep{Boily2015},
such as duration engaged in formal sex work \citep{Watts2010}.
Finally, turnover could reflect data on how sexual behaviour changes
following exit from a given risk group \citep{Boily2015}.
Most prior models used some combination of these constraints,
based on their specific data or research question,
but to date there is no unified approach to modelling turnover.
\par
In this study, we explored the mechanisms by which turnover
may influence the tPAF of a high risk group
using an illustrative STI model
with treatment-induced immunity and without STI-attributable mortality.
First, we developed a unified approach to
implementing turnover based on epidemiologic constraints.
We then sought the following objectives:
1)~understand the mechanisms by which turnover
influences group-specific STI prevalence and ratios of prevalence between risk groups;
2)~examine how inclusion/exclusion of turnover in a model influences
the level of risk heterogeneity inferred during model fitting; and
3)~examine how inclusion/exclusion of turnover in a model influences
the projected tPAF of the highest risk group
after model fitting to a particular setting.
