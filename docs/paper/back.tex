\section*{Acknowledgements}
We would like to thank Kristy Yiu (**affiliation?) for her logistical support,
and attendees of the STI \& HIV 2019 World Congress,
including Ian Spicknall, Janneke Heijne, Geoff Garnett, and Sevgi Aral,   
for their thoughtful discussions and feedback on this work. %SM, I don't think need to thank them all unless their specific input was helpful but did not meet IJME criteria for authorship - indeed, we can put them as reviewers! Acknowledgement usually involves a bit more than this - unless you spent at least an hour talking with them and incorporating their feedback/inputs :). Or else you will have very long lists of folks when you present any work at a conference before a paper is submitted! Also - in some journals (like Lancet family) - have to get signatures from everyone named in acknowledgements (which is going to be the way of the future), so acknowledgments are meant to reflect meaningful (non-author) contributions :).  I would argue that folks on the NIH team - Carly, David Dowdy, etc. could have had more opportunity to be acknowledged :).
We thank the Siyambapili research team for helpful discussions and Carly Commins (Johns Hopkins University)
for facilitating the modeling meetings with the wider study team. %check spelling of study trial name as per Carly's protocol paper. also - we should say on behalf of the Siyambapilii team or soemthing like that in title I think (we can confirm with Stef).
SM is supported by an Ontario HIV Treatment Network and
Canadian Institutes of Health Research New Investigator Award.
