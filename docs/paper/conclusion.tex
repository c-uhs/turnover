That's it!
We've hopefully illustrated the importance of including
population heterogeneity, growth, and turnover
in deterministic compartmental epidemic models.
Such features can have enormous effects on
the model projections, and almost always constitute
a more accurate representation of real-world systems.
We've also provided tools for implementing and parameterizing these dynamics,
considering data which are typically available,
and assuming steady-state risk group sizes.
So go forth, and build better models.
