\subsection{Experiment~1: Mechanisms by which turnover influences equilibrium prevalence}
\label{ss:res-prevalence}
Figure~\ref{fig:prevalence} shows the trends in equilibrium STI prevalence among the
high~(\subref{fig:prevalence-high}),
medium~(\subref{fig:prevalence-med}), and
low~(\subref{fig:prevalence-low})
risk groups, at different rates of turnover
which are depicted on the x-axis,
based on duration of time spent in the high risk group.
Figure~\ref{fig:prevalence} reveals an inverted U-shaped relationship
between STI prevalence and turnover in all three risk groups.
That is, equilibrium STI prevalence was higher in systems with slow turnover
versus those with no turnover
(Figure~\ref{fig:prevalence}, region~A).
Equilibrium STI prevalence then peaked at slightly faster turnover
before declining in systems with even faster turnover
(region~B in Figure~\ref{fig:prevalence}).
Comparison of group-specific prevalence in Figure~\ref{fig:prevalence} shows that
the threshold turnover rate at which group-specific prevalence peaked varied by risk group:
prevalence in the high risk group peaked at the lower turnover threshold
(Figure~\ref{fig:prevalence-high}),
while prevalence in low risk group peaked at a higher turnover threshold
(Figure~\ref{fig:prevalence-low}).
To explain the inverted U-shape and different turnover thresholds by group,
we examined the processes contributing to prevalence,
first in the high risk group, and then in the low risk group.
Prevalence in the medium risk group is then driven by a combination of these processes;
as such, we don't detail the processes in the context of the medium risk group.

\subsubsection{Influence of turnover on equilibrium prevalence in the high risk group}
\label{sss:res-prev-high}
As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:flows}, at all four rates of turnover
the proportion of individuals who were in the infectious state (STI prevalence)
was largest in the high risk group.
As infectious individuals left the high risk group via turnover,
they were largely replaced by susceptible individuals from lower risk groups
(Figure~\ref{fig:flows-low} and
Figures~\ref{fig:dX-high-S}~vs~\ref{fig:dX-high-I}, yellow).
The pattern of net outflow of infectious individuals
from the high risk group via turnover
persisted across the range of turnover rates
(Figure~\ref{fig:dX-high-I}, yellow).
This net outflow of infectious individuals via turnover
acted to reduce STI prevalence in the high risk group
(phenomenon~1).
Treated individuals were similarly replaced largely by susceptible individuals
(Figure~\ref{fig:flows-low} and
Figures~\ref{fig:dX-high-S}~vs~\ref{fig:dX-high-T}, yellow).
The net replacement of both infectious and treated individuals with susceptible individuals
in the high risk group acted to reduce herd effect in that group.
Reduced herd effect then contributed to a rise in
the number of incident infections in the high risk group,
as the system moved from no turnover to slow turnover
(Figure~\ref{fig:dX-high-I}, red; phenomenon~2).
Incidence was further influenced by a third phenomenon
as systems moved from no turnover to higher rates of turnover:
the net movement of infectious individuals
from high to low risk (Figure~\ref{fig:flows-low})
reduced the average number of partners per year made available by
individuals in the infectious state (Figure~\ref{fig:C-I}).
As shown in Appendix~\ref{aa:eqs-incidence},
modelled incidence in all risk groups was proportional to
the average number of partners per year among infectious individuals
(Figure~\ref{fig:C-I}),
and overall prevalence
(Figure~\ref{fig:prevalence-all}).
Thus, as the average number of partners per year among infectious individuals
fell with faster turnover, incidence decreased
(Figure~\ref{fig:incidence-all}, region~B; phenomenon~3).
\par
Therefore, the inverted U-shaped relationship between turnover rate
and equilibrium STI prevalence in the high risk group was mediated
by the combination of the above three phenomena.
When systems moved from no turnover to slow turnover,
reduction in herd effect (phenomenon~2) predominated,
leading to increasing equilibrium prevalence with turnover
(Figure~\ref{fig:prevalence-high}, region~A).
When systems were modelled under faster and faster turnover,
outflow of infectious individuals from the group via turnover (phenomenon~1) and
reduction in the average number of partners per year among infectious individuals (phenomenon~3)
predominated, leading to lower equilibrium prevalence at faster rates of turnover
(Figure~\ref{fig:prevalence-high}, region~B).

\subsubsection{Influence of turnover on equilibrium prevalence in the low risk group}
\label{sss:res-prev-low}
As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:flows}, at equilibrium, the low risk group was
composed mainly of susceptible individuals.
Moving from a system no turnover to one with slow turnover
lead to a net inflow of infectious and treated individuals
(Figures~\ref{fig:dX-low-I}~and~\ref{fig:dX-low-T}, yellow),
and a net removal of susceptible individuals
(Figure~\ref{fig:dX-low-S}, yellow).
The net inflow of infectious individuals
(Figure~\ref{fig:dX-low-I}, yellow) contributed to
higher equilibrium prevalence in the low risk group
when the system moved from no turnover to slow turnover
(phenomenon~1).
The inflow of infectious and treated individuals
only slightly reduced the already large proportion who were susceptible
in the low risk group.
Thus, there was little increase in herd effect within the low risk group
as turnover increased
(phenomenon~2).
However, incident infections still rose in the low risk group
as the system moved from no turnover to slow turnover
(Figure~\ref{fig:dX-low-I}, red)
due to higher incidence in the total population (Figure~\ref{fig:incidence-all})
which was largely driven by
reduced herd effect in the high risk group
(see Section~\ref{sss:res-prev-high}; phenomenon~2).
Under faster rates of turnover,
incident infections declined in the low risk group
(Figure~\ref{fig:dX-low-I}, red)
due to lower incidence in the total population
(Figure~\ref{fig:incidence-all})
which was driven by
decreasing number of partners per year among infectious individuals
(Figure~\ref{fig:C-I}; phenomenon~3),
as described in Section~\ref{sss:res-prev-high}.
\par
Therefore, as in the high risk group,
the inverted U-shaped relationship between turnover rate
and equilibrium STI prevalence in the low risk group was mediated
by the combination of the above three phenomena.
Moving from no turnover to slow turnover,
the net inflow of infectious individuals (phenomenon~1)
and reduced herd effect in the high risk group (phenomenon~2)
predominated, leading to higher equilibrium prevalence
(Figure~\ref{fig:prevalence-low}, region~A).
At higher rates of turnover,
a decreasing overall incidence due to
a reduction in the number of partners among infectious individuals (phenomenon~3)
predominated, leading to declining equilibrium prevalence
(Figure~\ref{fig:prevalence-low}, region~B).
\par
In sum, there were three phenomena that
drove shifts in equilibrium STI prevalence across risk groups
at variable rates of turnover:
1)~net flows of infectious individuals from high risk groups into low risk groups;
2)~changes to herd effect, especially within the high risk group; and
3)~changes to the number of partnerships available with infectious individuals.
The effects of these phenomena on the medium risk group were
a mixture of the effects on the high and low risk groups,
as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:dX-med-S}--\ref{fig:dX-med-T},
leading to the unique profile shown in Figure~\ref{fig:prevalence-med}.
% --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Influence of turnover on STI prevalence ratio between high and low risk groups}
As discussed in Sections~\ref{sss:res-prev-high}~and~\ref{sss:res-prev-low},
turnover caused
a net outflow of infectious individuals from the high risk group
(Figure~\ref{fig:dX-high-I}, yellow) and
a net inflow of infectious individuals into the low risk group
(Figure~\ref{fig:dX-low-I}, yellow).
In contrast, the influence of turnover on
the rate of incident infections followed a more similar pattern
in both the high and low risk groups
(Figures~\ref{fig:dX-high-I}~and~\ref{fig:dX-low-I}, red).
Therefore, differences in the influence of turnover on prevalence between risk groups
were driven by net movement of infectious individuals from high to low risk,
causing prevalence in the high and low risk groups
to come closer together with faster turnover.
As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ratio-prevalence-high-low},
the ratio of equilibrium STI prevalence in the high versus low risk groups
was thus reduced under faster turnover rates.
For example, the prevalence ratio
between high and low risk groups was:
$\input{\datapath/values/turnover-prevalence-ratio-high-low.txt}$
in the model under high turnover ($\delta_H = 5$~years) versus
$\input{\datapath/values/no-turnover-prevalence-ratio-high-low.txt}$
in the model without turnover ($\delta_H = 33$~years)
(Table~\ref{tab:fitting}).
Finally, the propensity for equilibrium STI
prevalence to decrease in the high risk group and for
prevalence to increase in the low risk group with faster turnover
(due to net movement of infectious individuals from high to low risk)
also explains why prevalence peaked at
slower turnover in the high risk group
(Figure~\ref{fig:prevalence-high}) and
faster turnover in the low risk group
(Figure~\ref{fig:prevalence-low}).
\begin{figure}
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{{1d-ratio-prevalence-high-low-tau=0.1}.pdf}}
  \caption{Equilibrium prevalence ratios between high and low risk groups
    under different rates of turnover.}
  \label{fig:ratio-prevalence-high-low}
  \footnotesize\input{x-axis.tex}
\end{figure}
% ==================================================================================================
\subsection{Experiment~2: Inferred risk heterogeneity with versus without turnover}
\label{ss:res-infer}
After model fitting,
our two STI transmission models
(one with turnover and one without turnover)
reproduced the target equilibrium STI prevalence values of 20\%,~8.75\%,~3\%,~and~5\%
in the high, medium, low risk groups, and total population, respectively
(Table~\ref{tab:fitting}; Figure~\ref{fig:tpaf-prevalence}).
When fitting the model with turnover to these group-specific prevalence targets,
the fitted numbers of partners per year $C_i$ (the only non-fixed parameter)
had to compensate for the reduction in
STI prevalence ratio between high and low risk groups
(Figure~\ref{fig:ratio-prevalence-high-low}).
As a result, the ratio of fitted partner numbers
between high and low risk groups ($C_H~/~C_L$)
had to be higher in the model with turnover compared to the model without turnover:
$\input{\datapath/values/turnover-[fit]-C-ratio-high-low.txt}$~vs~%
$\input{\datapath/values/no-turnover-[fit]-C-ratio-high-low.txt}$
(Table~\ref{tab:fitting}).
That is, the inferred level of risk heterogeneity was higher
in the model with turnover than in the model without turnover.
\begin{table}

    among the high and low risk groups
    predicted by the models with and without turnover,

\end{table}
% ==================================================================================================
\subsection{Experiment~3: Influence of turnover on the tPAF of the high risk group}
\label{ss:res-tpaf}
Finally, we compared the tPAF of the high risk group
projected by the fitted model with turnover and the fitted model without turnover
(Figure~\ref{fig:tpaf-fit}).
The tPAF projected by both models
increased over longer and longer time horizons,
indicating that unmet prevention and treatment needs of the high risk group
were central to epidemic persistence in both fitted models.
The model with turnover projected a larger tPAF at all
time-horizons compared with the tPAF projected by the model without turnover.
The larger tPAF projected by the model with turnover
stemmed from more risk heterogeneity (Table~\ref{tab:fitting})
which led to more onward transmission from the unmet
prevention and treatment needs of the high risk group.
