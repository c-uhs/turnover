\subsection{Experiment~1: Mechanisms by which turnover influences equilibrium prevalence}
\label{ss:res-prevalence}
Figure~\ref{fig:prevalence} shows the trends in equilibrium STI prevalence  			
among the high, medium, low, risk groups, at different rates of turnover which 		%SM: suggest refer to Figure panels in text ".... the high (Figure 4a), medium (Figure 4b), ... etc. 
are depicted on the x-axis as
duration of time spent in the high risk group.
First, Figure~\ref{fig:prevalence} reveals an inverted U-shaped relationship
between STI prevalence and turnover in all three risk groups.
That is, equilibrium STI prevalence is higher in systems with slow turnover 
versus those with no turnover 
(region~A in Figure~\ref{fig:prevalence} ). Equilibrium STI prevalence then peaked						%SM: when talking about Region in the text, must refer to the figure.
at slightly faster turnover before declining in systems with even faster turnover 
(region~B in Figure~\ref{fig:prevalence} ).
Second, comparison of group-specific prevalence in Figure~\ref{fig:prevalence} shows that
the threshold turnover rate at which group-specific prevalence peaked
varied by risk group.
Prevalence in the high risk group peaked at the lower turnover threshold
(Figure~\ref{fig:prevalence-high}),
while prevalence in low risk group peaked at a higher turnover threshold								
(Figure~\ref{fig:prevalence-low}).

%SM: Figure 4 and Figure 5. (and appendix figures). suggest could make it more clear that 0.03 = no turnover in the caption. Figures should be stand-alone and 'no turnover' is not clear at all when reading those figures without the main text. 

To explain the inverted U-shape and different turnover thresholds by group,							%SM: good. could follow this :). 
we examined the components contributing to prevalence,
first in the high risk group, and then in the low risk group.

Figure~\ref{fig:dX-I} shows the four components which contributed to 
gain/loss of infectious individuals in each risk group:
1)~net gain/loss via turnover,
2)~gain via incident infections,
3)~loss via treatment, and
4)~loss via death,
for each risk group in the model,
at equilibrium under different rates of turnover.
Figure~\ref{fig:flows} also illustrates
the distribution of health states in each risk group
and among individuals moving between risk groups
under four different rates of turnover.
% --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Influence of turnover on equilibrium prevalence in the high risk group}		%SM: becuase there are so many figures, i think will have to refer to the figure in almost every sentence. Before sending me the penulitmate version, please read out loud and check if any sentences seem unclear as to which figure they are referring to, etc.
\label{sss:res-prev-high}
As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:flows} at all four rates of turnover,
the proportion of individuals 
who were in the infectious state was largest in the high risk group. 
As infectious individuals left
the high risk group via turnover, they were largely 
replaced by susceptible individuals from lower risk groups (Figure C.7b). 		%SM: refer here to Figure 7b in Appendix so that the "numbers" can be corroborated.
For example, in the context of slow turnover (Figure 6b, Figure C.7b), 			%SM for each statement --> give clear example with numbers to support the statement.
X percent of individuals in the high risk group were in the infectious state,
and the absolute rate of change of the infectious state 
attributable to turnover was -XX (Figure C.7b) while the
absolute rate of change in the susceptible state attributable to 
turnover was +XX (Figure C.7a). The pattern of net loss of 
infectious individuals in the high risk group via turnover
persisted across the range of turnover rates (Figure~\ref{fig:dX-I-high}, yellow).			%SM: and Figure 7b?
This net loss of infectious individuals via turnover 
reduced STI prevalence within the high risk group (Figure XXX). 					%SM: insert right figure call out
At the same time, 
there was a net increase in susceptible individuals flowing into the high risk group
(Figure~\ref{fig:flows}) - the consequence of which was reduced protective herd effects
leading to a rise in incident infections among those at high risk when systems moved from 
no turnover to slow turnover (Figure~\ref{fig:dX-I-high}, red).
A third phenomena further mediated incidence reductions as systems
moved from no turnover to higher rates of turnover: 
the net movement of infectious individuals
from high to low risk (Figure~\ref{fig:flows}) reduced
the average number of partners per year on offer or available among 
individuals in the infectious state
(Figure~\ref{fig:C-I}). 
As shown in Appendix~\ref{aa:eqs-incidence},
modelled incidence in all risk groups was proportional to
the average number of partners per year among infectious individuals
(Figure~\ref{fig:C-I}),
and overall prevalence
(Figure~\ref{fig:prevalence-all}).
Thus, as the average number of partners per year among infectious individuals
fell with faster turnover, incidence decreased
(Figure~\ref{fig:incidence-all}).


\par
Therefore, the inverted U-shaped relationship between turnover rate
and equilibrium STI prevalence within the high risk group was mediated
by the above three phenomena acting in concert. When systems moved 
from no turnover to 
slow turnover, reduction in herd effects predominated leading to increasing
equilbrium prevalence in the presence of some turnover 
(region~A of Figure~\ref{fig:prevalence-high}).
When systems were modelled under faster and faster turnover,
removal of infectious individuals via turnover and changes in the characteristic of the 
sexual network (i.e. reduction in average number of partners per year among infectious individuals) 
predominated, leading to lower equlibrium prevalence
at faster rates of turnover (Figure~\ref{fig:prevalence-high}, region~B).
Accordingly, the inverted U-shaped relationship between turnover rate and equlibrium incidence 
followed a similar pattern within all three groups.

Not sure how it flowed nor what the main point was. suggest rephrase for clarity (?mutally enforcing exponential decline = wordy and unclear and makes reader feel dumb :) or remove or use suggested edits (but not sure if that is what you meant) = in sentence above.
%Moreover, as equilibrium incidence decreased across all groups
%with faster turnover for the same reason,
%equilibrium prevalence then decreased, which in turn reduced incidence,
%and so on in a mutually reinforcing exponential decline
(Figure~\ref{fig:prevalence}, region~B).

\subsubsection{Influence of turnover on equilibrium prevalence in the low risk group}
\label{sss:res-prev-low}
As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:flows}, at equilibrium, the low risk group was
composed mainly of susceptible individuals (e.g. X percent susceptible at slow turnover, Figure 5 and Figure C.7g).
Moving from a system without turnover to one slow
turnover lead to a net influx of 
infectious (Figure Appendix C.7i) and treated (Figure C.7h) individuals and net removal of		%SM: Appendix Figure 7 currently hides the curves with the legend. Grey and black a bit hard to differentiate as well.
susceptible individuals (Figure C.7g). 		%SM: it is hard to see the decline in appendix figure C.7
The net influx of infectious individuals led to
higher equilibrium prevalence in the low risk group when the system
moved from no turnover to slow turnover
(Figure~\ref{fig:dX-I-low}, yellow).

%The net influx of treated individuals
%contributed to a small increase in herd immunity,
%but the herd immunity effect in the low risk group
%remained negligible due to
%the small proportion of treated relative to susceptible individuals. %SM: removed this sentence. I don't follow the logic. proportion "not susceptible" leads to herd effect. so the "due to..." part does not make sense to me the way currently written. If confusing me, may confuse others? So leave out as the statement also would require more 'evidence (i.e. show don't tell)' before it can be included as an explanation.

With slow versus no turnover,
incident infections also increased in the low risk group
(Figure~\ref{fig:dX-I-low}, red),
driven by increasing overall incidence
(Figure~\ref{fig:incidence-all}),
ultimately attributable to reduced herd immunity in the high risk group
(see Section~\ref{sss:res-prev-high}).

The net gain of infectious individuals via turnover and increasing incident infections
then both increased equilibrium prevalence in the low risk group
under slow versus no turnover
(Figure~\ref{fig:prevalence-low}, region~A).
\par
Faster rates of turnover still contributed a net gain of infectious individuals
via movement of already infected individuals.
However, as in the high risk group,
the rate of incident infections decreased
in the low risk group under faster rates of turnover
(Figure~\ref{fig:dX-I-low}, red),
due to decreasing overall incidence
(Figure~\ref{fig:incidence-all})
via decreasing number of partners per year among infectious individuals
(Figure~\ref{fig:C-I}).
As a result, equilibrium prevalence decreased in the low risk group as turnover increased
(Figure~\ref{fig:prevalence-low}, region~B),
following the same exponential decline as in the high risk group
under very fast rates of turnover.
% --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Prevalence ratios and different turnover rates for peak prevalence among risk groups}
% JK: not really sure if this is the best title for this section.
The movement of individuals between risk groups via turnover yielded
a net loss of infectious individuals from the high risk group, but
a net gain of infectious individuals in the low risk group
(Figure~\ref{fig:dX-I}, yellow).
By comparison, the influence of turnover on
the rate of incident infections was relatively similar
among high versus low risk groups (Figure~\ref{fig:dX-I}, red).
Thus, the net effect of increasing turnover in the high risk group
\emph{tended towards} decreasing prevalence,
whereas in the low risk group,
the net effect \emph{tended towards} increasing prevalence.
Since these two tendencies act to bring prevalence in the two groups
closer together, we describe the overall tendency as
the ``homogenizing effect'' of turnover on group-specific prevalence.%
\footnote{The level of risk heterogeneity experienced by individuals in the model
  also decreases with faster turnover;
  this decrease in risk heterogeneity
  could also be described as a ``risk homogenizing effect''.}
% JK: I remember we had agreed on ``reducing risk heterogeneity'' versus ``risk homogenizing''
%     
The homogenizing effect is demonstrated in Figure~\ref{fig:ratio-prevalence},
which shows the equilibrium prevalence ratios
in pair-wise comparisons of all three risk groups.
The prevalence ratio between highest and lowest risk groups
monotonically decreased with turnover
(Figure~\ref{fig:ratio-prevalence-high-low}).
% JK: I don't talk about prevalence ratios between high/med or med/low.
%     They're difficult to explain and I'm not sure it add anything,
%     especially considering we haven't discussed the medium risk group
%     at all in this section...
The homogenizing effect is also why, in the high risk group,
lower rates of turnover were required
to have a net decreasing effect on prevalence,
as compared to in the low risk group.
That is, the threshold rate of turnover at which
prevalence in the high risk group peaked and then declined
was lower than in the low risk group
(Figure~\ref{fig:prevalence}).

\subsection{Experiment~2: Inferred risk heterogeneity with vs without turnover}
\label{ss:res-infer}
Next, we compared the fitted parameters in models with versus without turnover
($\delta_H = 5$ vs $\delta_H = 33$ years).
Before model fitting, the predicted prevalence ratio
between high and low risk groups was lower with turnover versus without:
$\input{\datapath/values/turnover-prevalence-ratio-high-low.txt}$~vs~%
$\input{\datapath/values/no-turnover-prevalence-ratio-high-low.txt}$,
reflecting the homogenizing effect of turnover on group-specific prevalence
(Figure~\ref{fig:ratio-prevalence-high-low}).
Thus, when fitting the model to target prevalence values,
the fitted numbers of partners per year $C$ would have to compensate for
this difference in prevalence ratio with versus without turnover.
\par
After fitting the number of partners per year, both models predicted
the target equilibrium infection prevalence values of 20\%,~8.75\%,~3\%,~and~5\%
among the high, medium, low risk groups, and overall
(Figure~\ref{fig:tpaf-prevalence}).
However, in order to do so, the ratio of fitted partners
between high and low risk groups ($C_H~/~C_L$)
was higher with turnover than without:
$\input{\datapath/values/turnover-[fit]-C-ratio-high-low.txt}$~vs~%
$\input{\datapath/values/no-turnover-[fit]-C-ratio-high-low.txt}$
(Table~\ref{tab:fitting}).
That is, the inferred level of risk heterogeneity was higher
in the model with turnover than in the model without turnover.
In order to observe the same prevalence ratio in a system with turnover,
the homogenizing effect of turnover must be overcome by
greater heterogeneity in risk, as compared to a system without turnover.
\begin{table}
  \centering
  \caption{Equilibrium partnership formation rates and prevalence
    among the high and low risk groups

\end{table}
% ==================================================================================================
\subsection{Experiment~3: Influence of turnover on the tPAF of the high risk group}
\label{ss:res-tpaf}
Finally, we compared the predicted tPAF of the high risk group
with and without turnover, after fitting to the same prevalence data
(Figure~\ref{fig:tpaf-fit}).
The tPAF approaches 1 for both models over the 50 year period,
indicating that unmet treatment needs of the high risk group
are central to epidemic persistence in both scenarios.
% SB: Crucial.
The estimated tPAF of the high risk group is also higher
in the model with turnover versus
in the model without turnover
over all time horizons,
implying that models which fail to capture turnover dynamics which are present in reality
may underestimate the tPAF of high risk groups.
This increase in tPAF of the high risk group can be attributed to
a higher ratio of fitted partners $C_H~/~C_L$
in the model with turnover is higher than in the model without
(Experiment~2).
The increased partner ratio affords
a higher risk of onward transmission to the high risk group
in the model with turnover, and thus an increase in tPAF.

% LW: I think this is the key message and valid.
% SS: This section perhaps could be a bit clearer as clearly very important
%     Is there a way to more explicitly talk about new infections
%     in the low / medium risks coming from prevalent infections
%     entering into these states from high risk groups and that
%     subsequent infections emanating from these individuals are thus still
%     linked back to prior history in the high risk group?
% JK: Great point and I realized this was not emphasized anywhere in the paper.
%     However, I think this section is not the right place for it,
%     as the increase in TPAF is really attributable to the higher estimated
%     partners ratio from Experiment 2.
%     However, I highlight that infections in low risk groups can originate
%     from higher risk period in the discussion,
%     since it kind of gets lost in Experiment 1.
