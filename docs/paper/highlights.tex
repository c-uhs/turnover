\begin{enumerate}	%SM: great list of highlights! perhaps just a bit more active voice :) 
  \item A new framework for parameterizing turnover in risk groups is proposed					%SM: perhaps 'developed' instead of proposed (former = stronger verb and still accurate)? parameterizing usually means based on data, so may be redundant for highlights I think
  \item Mechanisms by which turnover influences STI prevalence across risk groups are examined
  \item Faster turnover reduces the ratio of STI prevalence at equilibrium between high vs low risk groups
  \item Level of risk heterogeneity inferred is larger when fitting transmission models with turnover
  \item Ignoring turnover could underestimate the transmission population attributable fraction of high risk groups to overall transmission	%SM: not sure if highlights ok with acronyms, so perhaps write out the tPAF
  \end{enumerate}
