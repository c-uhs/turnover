\begin{enumerate}
  \item A new framework for parameterizing risk group turnover based on data is proposed
  \item The influence of turnover on risk group STI prevalence is examined mechanistically
  \item Equilibrium high-to-low STI prevalence ratio is reduced as turnover increases
  \item Risk heterogeneity inferred via model fitting is higher with turnover
  \item The tPAF of high risk groups can be underestimated if turnover in risk is ignored
\end{enumerate}
