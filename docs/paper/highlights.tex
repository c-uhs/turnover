\begin{enumerate}
  \item A new framework for parameterizing turnover in risk groups is developed
  \item Mechanisms by which turnover influences STI prevalence in risk groups are examined
  \item Turnover reduces the ratio of equilibrium STI prevalence in high vs low risk groups
  \item Inferred risk heterogeneity is higher when fitting transmission models with turnover
  \item Ignoring turnover in risk could underestimate the tPAF of high risk groups
\end{enumerate}
