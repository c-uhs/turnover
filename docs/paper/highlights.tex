\begin{enumerate}
  \item A new framework for parameterizing turnover in risk groups is developed
  \item Mechanisms by which turnover influences STI prevalence in risk groups are examined
  \item Turnover reduces the ratio of equilibrium STI prevalence in high vs low risk groups
  \item Inferred risk heterogeneity is higher when fitting transmission models with turnover
  \item Ignoring turnover in risk could underestimate the tPAF of high risk groups
  % SM: not sure if highlights ok with acronyms, so perhaps write out the tPAF
  % JK: I would, but strict 85 character limit (with spaces)! :\
  %     maybe we can leave as "tPAF" and see what editors say.
  %     I think tPAF is also defined on this page in the abbreviations
  % JK: For same 85-character reason, I made a few other small edits here ...
