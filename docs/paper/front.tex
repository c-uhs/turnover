%\title{Risk Group Turnover in Epidemic Models}
%\title{Influence of risk group dynamics on the transmission population attributable fraction in epidemic models: a mechanistic modelling analysis}
%\title{How does risk group dynamics influence the contribution of the highest risk groups to overall transmission? a mechanistic modelling analysis}
\title{Contribution of high risk groups to overall transmission
  may be underestimated without turnover:
  a mechanistic modelling analysis		 
  %In reading more -  I kind of like  "Influence of turnover on the transmission population attributable fraction: a mechanistic modelling analyses"
  %...I am good with either but lets get a vote from co-authors so they can also input (wondering if 'contribution of high risk groups' may be perceived as stigmatizing language maybe)? 
\tnoteref{x}}
% SS: Is this the final title? I think something a little more descriptive. SM: agree with Sheree and Stef. See my comments as well on slack Oct 15.
%     may catch a bit more attention perhaps
%     "The impact/importance of risk group turnover in epidemic models for sexually transmitted infections"
%     or perhaps something that highlights that this is contributing
%     a new method/guidance for how to parameterize turnover in models?
% SB: "Describing the Impact of Turnover in Epidemic Models of Sexually Transmitted Infections"
%     Maybe?
% JK: I read somewhere that titles including the main result are good at getting attention.
%     How about the current version?
%     "Contribution of high risk groups to overall transmission is underestimated without turnover: a mechanistic modelling analysis"
