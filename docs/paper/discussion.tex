% These trends echo previous observations \citep{Zhang2012,Henry2015}
% but highlight the dependence of the threshold effect on the duration of infectiousness.
% Furthermore, this implies that the rate of treatment required to achieve epidemic control
% is affected by turnover.
% Namely, since turnover acts to erode the core-group effect,
% the rate of treatment required to achieve epidemic control will be
% lower with turnover than without.
% Models which fail to capture turnover dynamics might therefore be liable to
% overestimate the treatment rate required to achieve epidemic control.
