% These trends echo previous observations \citep{Zhang2012,Henry2015}
% but highlight the dependence of the threshold effect on the duration of infectiousness.
% Furthermore, this implies that the rate of treatment required to achieve epidemic control
% is affected by turnover.
% Namely, since turnover acts to erode the core-group effect,
% the rate of treatment required to achieve epidemic control will be
% lower with turnover than without.
% Models which fail to capture turnover dynamics might therefore be liable to
% overestimate the treatment rate required to achieve epidemic control.

% noting results w.r.t. fitted models: should probably fit rates of turnover

%It is worth comparing these results with the findings of \cite{Henry2015},
%who observed that increasing turnover consistently decreased $R_0$ in a model of HIV.%
%\footnote{\cite{Henry2015} use a parameter called the ``re-selection rate'' $\omega$
%  to control the magnitude of turnover;
%  this rate is functionally equivalent to
%  a uniform scaling factor of the turnover rates $\phi$ used here.}
%\citeauthor{Henry2015} highlight the reduction of
%contact rates among infected individuals via turnover in their explanation of
%the effect of turnover on $R_0$.
%However, they also assume that acute infections are more infectious than chronic,
%complicating the relationship between turnover and $R_0$.
%Such an assumption is clearly plausible for many infections,
%but it's not clear whether their conclusions regarding the effect of turnover on $R_0$
%hold without this assumption.
