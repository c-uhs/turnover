Introduction:
Mathematical models of the transmission of 
sexually transmitted infections (STI) are used to 
estimate the transmission population attributable fraction (tPAF)
of unmet prevention and treatment needs of risk groups to the overall epidemic.
Models usually risk-stratify by sexual activity and access to health services; few
capture movement between risk groups (turnover in risk).
Model comparisons have shown that excluding turnover in fitted STI models can underestimate the tPAF of high risk groups, but 
comparisons to date assumed random (proportionate) sexual mixing (partnership formation) between risk groups.
Because epidemiological data suggest like-with-like (assortative) mixing in sexual networks, 
we compared the relative difference in tPAF estimated by
a fitted model with versus without risk group turnover under assortative versus proportionate mixing.

Methods:
We used a transmission model of an illustrative STI,
with susceptible, infectious, and recovered/treated health states,
and three risk groups defined by different sexual partnership rates.
We fit four model variants to group-specific partnership rates
to reproduce the same group-specific STI prevalence targets at equilibrium.
The variants were: proportionate versus partially-assortative mixing; and no turnover versus turnover.
We then compared the 10-year tPAF of the high risk group
projected by each model variant.

Results:
Under proportionate mixing, the model without turnover estimated a smaller tPAF
compared to the model with turnover (75.9% vs 80.4%, 5.6% relative reduction)
Ignoring turnover underestimated the tPAF because to generate the same STI prevalence, 
models without turnover inferred
smaller differences in partnership rates between risk groups.
The influence of turnover on tPAF was larger under assortative mixing: 
tPAF without turnover was 50.5 versus 64.3 with turnover (21.5 relative reduction).
The bias from ignoring turnover was larger under assortative mixing 
because turnover allowed infections to escape the assortative sexual network in the high risk group  
via movement of infectious individuals into lower risk groups: that is, turnover enhanced "connections" between the high risk and lower risk groups.

Conclusion:
Transmission models without risk group turnover may underestimate the 
importance of reaching and prioritizing high risk groups in the context of risk-stratified STI interventions; 
a bias that may be larger if the sexual network is characterized by some degree of assortative mixing.
