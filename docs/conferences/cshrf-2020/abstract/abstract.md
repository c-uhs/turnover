Introduction:
Mathematical models of sexually transmitted infections (STI)
can project the transmission population attributable fraction (tPAF)
to quantify the population-level impact of
unmet STI treatment and prevention needs across risk groups.
Risk-strata are often modelled to reflect
heterogeneity in sexual activity and in access to health services.
However, movement between risk groups (turnover in risk) is not often modelled.
Previous work has shown that failure to capture risk group turnover in fitted STI models
can underestimate the tPAF of high risk groups. Another fundamental feature of
STIs is who has sex with whom (sexual mixing patterns), and the previous analyses assumed random (proportionate) sexual mixing between risk groups.
However, epidemiological data suggest like-with-like (assortative) mixing in sexual networks.
We aimed to quantify the relative difference in 10-year tPAF estimated by
a fitted model with versus without risk group turnover under assortative vs. proportionate mixing.

Methods:
We used a previously developed transmission model, representing an illustrative STI,
with susceptible, infectious, and recovered health states,
and three risk groups defined by different partnership formation rates.
We considered four model variants:
proportionate versus assortative mixing; and no turnover versus turnover.  %fully assortative or a degree of assortative?
For each variant, we fit group-specific partnership formation rates
to reproduce the same group-specific STI prevalence targets at equilibrium.
We then compared the 10-year tPAF of the high risk group
projected by models with versus without turnover,
under proportionate mixing and under assortative mixing.

Results:
Under both mixing conditions,
the 10-year tPAF of the high risk group was lower without turnover versus with turnover
(proportionate mixing: 75.9% vs 80.4%, 5.6% relative reduction;
assortative mixing: 50.5% vs 64.3%, 21.5% relative reduction)
Ignoring turnover led to underestimating the tPAF
because model fitting to the same STI prevalence targets
required smaller differences between risk groups in rates of partnership formation.
Under assortative mixing, the inclusion or exclusion of turnover has a larger influence 
on the tPAF because....%SM: the main question is about underestimating tPAF so would focus on explaining that clearly?

%SM: did not understand these two sentences - compared to proportonate, what is being explained? 
%Under assortative mixing, the tPAF of the high risk group was also reduced,
%regardless of turnover, due to fewer partnerships between risk groups.
%However, turnover partially circumvented this obstacle to onward transmission
%through movement of infectious individuals from high to low risk groups,
%thus widening the gap in tPAF estimated with vs without turnover under assortative mixing.

Conclusion:
Transmission models without risk group turnover may underestimate the 
importance of reaching and prioritizing high risk groups in the context of risk-stratified interventions.
Such biases in estimates may be amplified if the sexual network is characterized by some degree of assortative mixing.
