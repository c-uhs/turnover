Introduction:
Mathematical models of sexually transmitted infections (STI)
can project the transmission population attributable fraction (tPAF)
to quantify the population-level impact of
unmet treatment and prevention needs among particular risk groups.
Such risk groups are often modelled to reflect
differences in sexual behaviour and barriers to care.
However, movement between risk groups (turnover in risk) is not often modelled.
Previous work has shown that failure to capture risk group turnover in fitted STI models
can underestimate the tPAF of high risk groups.
The previous analyses assumed random (proportionate) sexual mixing between risk groups,
whereas empiric data suggest like-with-like (assortative) mixing.
Therefore, we aimed to quantify the relative difference in 10-year tPAF estimated by
a fitted model with versus without risk group turnover under assortative mixing conditions.

Methods:
We used a previously developed transmission model, representing an illustrative STI,
with susceptible, infectious, and recovered health states,
and three risk groups defined by different partnership formation rates.
We considered four model variants, reflecting:
proportionate versus assortative mixing; and no turnover versus turnover.
For each variant, we fit group-specific partnership formation rates
to reproduce the same group-specific STI prevalence targets at equilibrium.
We then compared the 10-year tPAF of the high risk group
projected by models with versus without turnover,
under proportionate mixing and under assortative mixing.

Results:
Under both mixing conditions,
the 10-year tPAF of the high risk group was lower without turnover versus with turnover
(proportionate mixing: 75.9% vs 80.4%, 5.6% relative reduction;
assortative mixing: 50.5% vs 64.3%, 21.5% relative reduction)
because model fitting to the same STI prevalence targets
required smaller differences between risk groups in rates of partnership formation.
Under assortative mixing, the tPAF of the high risk group was also reduced,
regardless of turnover, due to fewer partnerships between risk groups.
However, turnover partially circumvented this obstacle to onward transmission
through movement of infectious individuals from high to low risk groups,
thus widening the gap in tPAF estimated with vs without turnover under assortative mixing.

Conclusion:
Failure to simulate risk group turnover in transmission models
can result in underestimated importance of reaching high risk groups with care.
Such underestimation could be larger
under assortative versus proportionate mixing among risk groups.
