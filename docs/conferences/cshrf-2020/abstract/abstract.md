Introduction:
Mathematical models of sexually transmitted infections (STI)
can quantify the population-level impact of
unmet STI treatment and prevention needs across risk groups
using the transmission population attributable fraction (tPAF).
Risk groups are often modelled to reflect heterogeneity in sexual activity and access to health services.
However, movement between risk groups (turnover in risk) is not often modelled.
Previous work has shown that failure to capture risk group turnover in fitted STI models
can underestimate the tPAF of high risk groups.
Previous analyses assumed random (proportionate) sexual mixing (partnership formation) between risk groups.
However, epidemiological data suggest like-with-like (assortative) mixing in sexual networks.
Therefore, we aimed to quantify the relative difference in 10-year tPAF estimated by
a fitted model with versus without risk group turnover under assortative versus proportionate mixing.

Methods:
We used a previously developed transmission model, representing an illustrative STI,
with susceptible, infectious, and recovered health states,
and three risk groups defined by different partnership formation rates.
We considered four model variants:
proportionate versus partially-assortative mixing; and no turnover versus turnover.
For each variant, we fit group-specific partnership formation rates
to reproduce the same group-specific STI prevalence targets at equilibrium.
We then compared the 10-year tPAF of the high risk group
projected by models with versus without turnover,
under proportionate mixing and under assortative mixing.

Results:
Under proportionate mixing,
the 10-year tPAF of the high risk group was lower without turnover versus with turnover
(75.9% vs 80.4%, 5.6% relative reduction)
Ignoring turnover led to underestimated tPAF because model fitting to the same STI prevalence targets
required smaller differences between risk groups in rates of partnership formation.
Under assortative mixing, ignoring turnover reduced tPAF further
(50.5% vs 64.3%, 21.5% relative reduction)
because turnover allowed infections to escape the assortative sexual network in the high risk group
via movement of infectious individuals into lower risk groups.

Conclusion:
Transmission models without risk group turnover may underestimate the 
importance of reaching and prioritizing high risk groups in the context of risk-stratified STI interventions.
Such underestimation may be larger if the sexual network is characterized by some degree of assortative mixing.
