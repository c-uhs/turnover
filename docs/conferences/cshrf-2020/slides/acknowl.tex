\newcommand{\xlogo}[2]{\raisebox{-0.5\height}{~\includegraphics[height=#1em]{#2}}~}  %SM: would just put the funders here: NSERC, NIH, CIHR. Since the title page has the affiliation anyway (and IMS, UofT is enough :))
\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{ccccccc}
  \xlogo{2.4}{cihr}  &
  \xlogo{2.4}{nserc} &
  \xlogo{1.7}{map}   &
  \xlogo{2.2}{smh}   &
  \xlogo{2.4}{uoft}
\end{array}
\end{equation*}

%SM: in acknowledgements, can add the names from the turnover paper (but don't say them in the recording)?
%SM: Disclosures: none
%SM: Funding: the logos (NSERC, NIH, CIHR)
%SM: Acknowledgements: the other names from turnover paper
