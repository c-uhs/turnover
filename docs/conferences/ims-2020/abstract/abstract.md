BACKGROUND
Mathematical models of sexually transmitted infections (STI) can help guide interventions,
such as by projecting the transmission population attributable fraction (tPAF)
of unmet treatment and prevention needs among particular risk groups.
Such risk groups may be identified by differences in sexual behaviour and barriers to care.
While transmission models typically stratify populations into several risk groups,
turnover of individuals between risk groups is not often modelled.
We previously showed that failure to model risk group turnover in fitted models
can result in underestimated impact of reaching high-risk groups with care.
However, in order to simplify the analysis,
we did not previously consider the well-known phenomenon of
assortative (like-with-like) sexual mixing among risk groups.
It's possible that such mixing could cause influence differences between
tPAF estimated by fitted models with and without turnover.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PURPOSE
We aimed to quantify the relative difference in 10-year tPAF estimated by
fitted models with vs without risk group turnover under assortative mixing among risk groups.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HYPOTHESIS
We hypothesized that underestimation of tPAF by the model without turnover
would be larger in the context of assortative risk group mixing,
as compared to proportionate mixing.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
METHODS
We used the previously developed model, representing an illustrative STI
with treatment-induced immunity and without infection-attributable mortality.
The model includes susceptible, infectious, and recovered health states,
and three risk groups defined by different rates of partnership formation.
We considered the following four model variants:
1) no turnover & proportionate mixing;
2) turnover and proportionate mixing;
3) no turnover & assortative mixing; and
4) turnover & assortative mixing.
Assortative mixing was implemented following Nold (1980) with Ïµ = 0.5.
For each variant, we fit the risk group-specific rates of partnership formation
in order to reproduce the same set of risk group-specific STI prevalence targets at equilibrium.
We then compared the 10-year tPAF of the high risk group
projected by the models with vs without turnover
under proportionate mixing (1 vs 2) and again under assortative mixing (3 vs 4).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RESULTS
Under proportionate mixing, the model without turnover (1) required less heterogeneity in risk
(differences in rates of partnership formation between risk groups)
to produce the same prevalence targets as the model with turnover (2).
Reduced risk heterogeneity then led to
lower 10-year tPAF of the high risk group in the model without turnover vs with turnover
(75.9% vs 80.4%, 5.6% relative reduction).
Similarly, under assortative mixing, less risk heterogeneity was required
to fit the model without turnover (3) vs with turnover (4),
contributing to lower tPAF of the high risk group without turnover.
The tPAF of the high risk group was also reduced under assortative mixing in general,
due to fewer partnerships and therefore less transmission
between the high risk group and other groups.
However, in the context of turnover,
reduced transmission from the high risk group due to assortative mixing
was circumvented by movement of infectious individuals
from the high risk group into other groups,
thereby facilitating additional onward transmission.
Thus failure to model turnover resulted in
even larger underestimation of the tPAF of the high risk group under assortative mixing
(50.5% vs 64.3%, 21.5% relative reduction).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONCLUSIONS
We previously showed that failure to simulate risk group turnover in transmission models
can result in underestimated importance of reaching high risk groups with care.
Here we showed that such underestimation could be even larger
in the context of assortative mixing among risk groups versus proportionate mixing.
